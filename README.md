Technologies used: MongoDB, Express, React, Node

Getting Started: https://project4sammersheikh.herokuapp.com/

Next Steps:

1. Add edit and delete functionality to todos
2. Add a pomodoro timer
3. Allow for completed todos to slide to bottom of list
4. Add separate todo items for Pomodoro break period that will be used by users to put their distracting thoughts during work time and only use break time to address those issues. Break-time issues are only to be addressed during break time and if all break-time issues are not completed then they will roll over to next break period
